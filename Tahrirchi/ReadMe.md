# Theoretical questions

## How would you automate this process so that we can get new datasets every day?
> If I have web-page that contains the list of all news ([for example](https://kun.uz/uz/news/list)), I can get up to date news using parser libraries, because this kind of pages are updated every day.

## What file format would you use to store this data?
> I can recommend `.csv`(Comma Separated Values) and `.xls`(MS Excel) file formats for this data.

## How would you evaluate the quality of the collected data?
> I cannot say that this data is not very clean. Because it contains some useless items like numbers and commonly used basic words (u, bu, va, ta, ...).
